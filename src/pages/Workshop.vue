          Learn how to communicate feminist research for maximum impact, uptake,
          and use by target audiences!
        </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          Knowledge translation is a core part of being an effective feminist
          researcher and advocate. It helps ensure that the information produced
          by feminist research is used to support evidence-based decision
          making, policy making, influencing, and social change. The ability to
          describe your knowledge translation strategy is also increasingly a
          requirement of research funding agencies, including the Social Science
          and Humanities Research Council.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this 3-hour online workshop, graduate students will learn about the
          practice of feminist knowledge translation and explore strategies to
          communicate research for maximum impact, uptake, and use by target
          audiences. A key aspect of feminist knoweldge translation is returning
          knowledge generated back to the communities that we work with, and
          ensuring its applicability and use for those who helped create it.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

        <p>By the end of the workshop, participants will understand how to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            design a feminist knowledge translation strategy for their research
          </li>
          <li>
            promote the uptake and use of their work by communities and target
            audiences
          </li>
          <li>
            think through practical and ethical issues in knowledge production
            and dissemination (e.g. impact, ownership, accessibility, power
            relations)
          </li>
          <li>
            produce different types of knowledge products and leverage them
            effectively
          </li>
          <li>evaluate the reach and impact of their work</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Workshop Design</h2>

        <p>
          This workshop is designed for graduate students in feminist studies,
          women's/gender studies, international development studies, and related
          social science programs. It is based on a training program developed
          for International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Research Awardees
          that has been run annually since 2019. It is designed using a curated
          and interactive approach, and includes the following components:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            an intake survey on participants' backgrounds and learning
            objectives
          </li>
          <li>
            a targeted workshop curriculum based on the results of the intake
            survey
          </li>
          <li>access to curated workshop readings, templates, and resources</li>
          <li>
            virtual facilitation over Zoom and the use of collaborative tools
            like Jamboard
          </li>
          <li>
            a practice component using a real world example or participants' own
            research
          </li>
          <li>a workshop certificate of completion</li>
        </ul>
